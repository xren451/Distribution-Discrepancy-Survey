# Distribution-Discrepancy-Learning: A Survey

We provide a Survey for distribution discrepancy learning. 

We have summarized the main branches of works for distribution discrepancy problem, which are composed by: unsupervised representation learning, supervised learning models and optimization methods. 
For more details, please refer to our survey on distribution discrepancy.

##Branch 1: Unsupervised Representation Learning.

##Branch 2: Supervised Learning Methods.

##Branch 3: Optimization.
